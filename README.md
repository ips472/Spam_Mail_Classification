# Spam_Mail_Classification
Spam messages are messages sent to a large group of recipients without their prior consent, typically advertising for goods and services or business opportunities.

In the recent period, the percentage of scam messages amongst spam have increased sharply. Scam messages typically trick people into giving away money or personal details by offering an attractive or false deal.

A spam message classification is a step towards building a tool for scam message identification and early scam detection.

The methodology is 

         1- Data Pre-processing and Exploratory Data Analysis
         2- Model Training, Comparison and Selection
         3- Model Evaluation
         
In this model I am using logistic regression machine learning technique to classify emails as either spam or non-spam(ham). Logistic regression uses a set of features (such as words, phrases, and other characteristics) to determine the probability that an email is spam. The model then assigns a score to each email based on the probability of it being spam. Emails with higher scores are more likely to be classified as spam, while those with lower scores are more likely to be classified as non-spam.
